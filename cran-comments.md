This is the update version of the package 'predict3d'. 

This version is compatible with the package ggplot2(>= 4.0.0).

I have fixed the errors shown on <https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_predict3d.html>
which are from the recent update of {ggplot2}.


## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.5.1 
* win-builder (devel and release)
* rhub

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
